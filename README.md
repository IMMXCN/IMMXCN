## Objective

Currently dedicated to entering the cybersecurity field as a Tier 1 SOC or MDR Analyst. I'm deeply intrigued by the dynamic nature of cybersecurity and its pivotal role in safeguarding digital systems.

Equipped with both theoretical knowledge and practical experience, I enthusiastically welcome challenges and see them as opportunities for personal and professional development. My strengths shine in collaborative environments, where I apply my analytical skills to fortify cyber defenses and confront threats directly.

My present goal is to attain CompTIA's CySA+ certification.
